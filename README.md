# Charity Coders RI

A project to connect software developers that want to shared their knowledge building web sites and applications with organizations or persons interested in build web sites and applications.

This is a good choice for entry level developers to implement their knowledge and add value to their portfolio.

This was my last project at General Assembly boot camp and consists of developing a client app to consume an api developed with Mongoose, ExpressJs and MongoDb.

## Development process and problem-solving strategy

I created user stories that project was going to have.
I created Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) tha project was going to have.
I created the neccesary wire frames for the project.

I started the backend api first and then the front end client.

I deployed both projects online.


## List unsolved problems
 There is not more features to implement in the future.
